Quantcast coding assessment by Kevin Luu

Python implementation of MostActiveCookie coding assessment from Quantcast, with testing script.

# Using Python shell, command is: python most_active_cookie.py FILENAME -d DATE
If a DATE is NOT provided, it will display the most active cookie from the entire file; meaning date is disregarded.

If a DATE is provided, it will display the most active cookie from only that date.
